# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

- Day 4: [React Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r25Y9Vg2P4&ab_channel=ByteGrad)
  - avoid props drilling by either:
    - using children approach
    - using state management approach:
      - context api
      - zustand
      - some other redux oriented pattern
- use single state instead of multiple states
  - example:
    - handling api call
      - declare multiple state variables:
        - isLoading
        - hasError
        - ...
      - instead use single status state variable, it will be an union
        - the status can be:
          - 'idle'
          - 'error'
          - 'success'
          - 'loading'
- Day 5: [React Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r25Y9Vg2P4&ab_channel=ByteGrad)
  - keep your code readable
    - create util functions for logic
      - if an util fn uses hooks, the util will be a custom hook
    - create components for markup
  - keep state in the url as well
    - examples:
      - filters
      - pagination
      - ids
    - don't use useState for those, laverage the info from the url
  - useEffect
    - one effect, one concern, do not mix concerns
  - fetching data
    - rely on third party solutions
      - example: [react query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query)
- Day 6:
  - collection of react [hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use)
  - [STOP using useState, instead put state in URL (in React & Next.js)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukpgxEemXsk&ab_channel=ByteGrad)
